edx-tools
=========

A collection of miscellaneous tools for use with the edX platform.

These tools might not be production quality - they may not be reviewed, may not do
error-handling, etc.  Use at your own risk.  Please also feel free to contribute tools
that are useful to you.  Almost anything will get merged.

Current directories include:
 - analytics (tools relevant to research and analysis of edX)
 - captions (for tools related to captions)
 - logging (for tools related to logging)
 - transcoding (tools to assist with transcoding of videos on AWS)
 - branch-drift (tools related to github and difference between branches and master)

 You could imagine a scenario where something that starts out used informally from this
 repo eventually gets adopted into the edx-platform repo.  But not everything will have to
 go that route.
