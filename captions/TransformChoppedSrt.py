"""
Takes a .srt file and produces a new .srt file which renumbers the captions from one,
and restarts the timing from 0 (subtracting the first timestamp from all timestamps)

Args:
    the filename of the original .srt file

Returns:
    a new .srt file is written, with the old filename with 'chopped_' prepended 
    e.g. 'myvideo.srt' -> 'chopped_.srt'
